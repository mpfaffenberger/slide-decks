We must still exercise caution by using a human-in-the-loop, however, as there are serious implications with real consequences - we have yet to arrive at full automation. If quantitative finance were a solved problem, there would be little to no money to make as the edge would be extracted by the solution - furthermore if that solution existed, it would not be open source or publicly available and would be protected more than nuclear launch codes and kept private for as long as possible.
